Title: criminalizing the act of a person claiming to be a member of
law enforcement when the person is not in uniform and cannot produce
identification proving the claim.

People claiming to be LEOs routinely harass citizens, but refuse to
identify themselves or provide their names or contact information.

Examples:

In one of these cases, multiple New Hampshire state reps asked the FBI
if the men who claimed to be FBI actually were representatives of the
FBI, and asked for FBI policy on identification, and we were ignored.

The fact that (actual ?) LEOs do not identify themselves makes it easy
for criminals to follow the exact same procedure, thus leading to
extremely dangerous home invasions:

There is no reason that LEOs (outside of high-risk situations,
exingent circumstances, and undercover operations) should not identify
themselves.  This would improve citizen safety and increase government accountability.
