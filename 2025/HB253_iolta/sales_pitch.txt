HB-253

LSR Number: 25-0390
Title: relative to interest-bearing pooled trust accounts maintained by lawyers.

New Hampshire attorneys often hold money intended for other parties in trust savings accounts while legal matters (e.g. inheritance, tort settlements, etc.) are resolved.

These accounts, which pool money from multiple cases, accrue interest, but the the interest is often too small to be worth allocating to the specific clients (e.g. $1.25 for client A, $5.00 for client B).  Under existing law and New Hampshire court rules, this money is 'taxed' and feeds into the Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts Program (IOLT).

The amount of money 'taxed' from New Hampshire citizens is just shy of $2 million per year.

This becomes a slush fund that the left-of-center Bar Association uses to reward favored causes.

Additionally, it's a source of influence peddling because many banks create special accounts that pay above market interest into IOLTA accounts "because they support the mission".  This is clearly extortion / influence buying.

Money flows to a variety of left-wing causes, including

* New Hampshire Catholic Charities, which helps resettle "refugees" in New Hampshire
  
* Manchester NAACP, which has a variety of troubling positions, from endorsing laws that criminalize the display of the Confederate flag, to defining discrimination as "disparate impact", etc.

* Disabilities Rights Center, which launches lawsuits against government and businesses

etc.

This bill redirects that cash flow towards public defenders - a cost that the state would otherwise be on the hook for, and a palatable way (even for Dems) to stop this flow of this slush-fund money to leftie
activist groups.

In fiscal year 2020-21, the Bar Foundation awarded grants totaling $950,000 to civil legal services programs raised from an IOLTA program.
