I have put forward a bill to reform IOLTA - the multiple small interest payments would, under my bill, go to defend the indigent against government prosecutors.

As I said, the NH Bar is the one that runs the program, and gets to decide how the slush fund will be spent.  You'll never guess who just came out against my bill...yes, that's right - the NH Bar!

Let's look into some quotes from the article:

"The NHPD did not seek or request this bill" 
 - NHPD Board President Michael Iacopino

Yes, 100% correct.

And Hitler did not seek or request the Allied D-Day landings.

We are on opposite sides here.  You're the enemy.

It's worth taking a moment to search US political donations database.

Needless to say, Iacopino has donated to all leftist causes, no conservative or libertarian ones.

Note also that Iacopino has been a board member of the public defender NGO ( EIN 02-0388924 ), but he's pushing back on his own org getting money - he'd rather funnel it to settling illegals, suing the state government, etc !

Next up, the NH Bar quotes...another NH Bar president (former):

"This bill blatantly violates Supreme Court Rule 50"

Such language!

"Blatantly violates"!!!

That's like saying that the RICO Act against organized crime blatantly violates the norms of La Cosa Nostra.

Yes, the NH Supreme Court has created internal rules, which result in a slush fund which unelected (by the public), unaccountable (to the public) members of the NH Bar get to send to lefist orgs.

However, the legislature exists, and laws take precedent over rules.

10/

That said, the drafters of the bill (me and 
@MikeBelcher14
 ) are aware that the Bar and the NH SC are well positioned to own details of implementation, and so the bill reads:

Another quote:

"IOLTA revenues should continue to flow to the Bar Foundation for distribution through its grant-making process to fund civil legal services"

 - NHLA Executive Director Sarah Mattson Dustin

Who is Sarah Dustin?

The acronyms are flying thick and fast, so take time to note that NHLA is NOT NHBA (NH Bar Association).

NHLA is New Hampshire Legal Assistance https://nhla.org

One of NHLA's program areas is helping settle illegals in New Hampshire.
nhla.org
Services â€” NH Legal Assistance
Legal Assistance services include: Housing, Public Benefits, Domestic Violence, Youth Law, Aging, and Immigration.

NHLA is also - wait for it - the SINGLE BIGGEST RECIPIENT of money from the IOLTA slush fund

https://nhba.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/17144259/Justice-Grant-History-2024.pdf

So the quotes of "please don't shut down our slush fund!!!" come from:

- a guy who is currently in charge of directing the slush fund
- a guy who used to be in charge of directing the slush fund
- the executive director of the single biggest recipient of the slush fund


It's all venal self-dealing and mutual back-scratching by hard-core lefties who work, every day, to make NH a worse place for hard-working citizens.
