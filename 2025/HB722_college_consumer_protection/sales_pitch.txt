Title: relative to establishing causes of actions against educational
institutions that charge excessive tuition rates.

New Hampshire protects its citizens against unfair and deceptive
business practices.

	The Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau enforces state and
	federal laws that make unfair and deceptive business practices
	unlawful.

One of the most vile deceptive business practice is selling a useless
degree to an impressionable 17 or 18 year old, which will cost them
four or more years of their lives, and potentially hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

Currently there is a loophole in our laws - while a car dealer, or
mattress store, etc would not be allowed to sell worthless / known
defective products, it's legal for educational institutions to sell
defective services.  ...with the added pain point that student loan
debt is the one kind of debt that's not dischargeable in bankruptcy.

"Student loan forgiveness" is a hot topic on the left, and provides a
lot of electoral energy.  We have an opportunity here to steal some of
that energy, and drive a wedge between college grads and the
institutions that preyed upon them.  Rhetorically, it's a great move.

The bill itself defines a deceptive degree as one that can not
reasonably be expected to pay for itself via increased earning power -
thus it identifies pure debt traps.

Of course, the rich should be allowed to get luxury degrees /
consumption goods (e.g. a bachelors in ancient French literature, or
art history), and thus the bill has an out where students can waive
their rights.

Also, the law only applies to Americans, so the business model of
fleecing foreigners can continue unabaited.
