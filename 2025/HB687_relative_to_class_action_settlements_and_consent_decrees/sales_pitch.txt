Title: relative to class action settlements and consent decrees.

A very common left-wing tactic is for a (left wing) activist attorney
to create a "class" of plaintiffs who have putatively been harmed by
state action.  They then sue the government, and leftists within the
government immediately roll over and settle the case ...often giving
the activists everything they want and more, and often agreeing to
future policy (and binding future administrations to the policy as the
settlement has the force of law).

At the federal level, Trump turned off "sue-and-settle" in the EPA in
2017, and Biden turned it back on in 2022.  This is clearly a partisan issue.

This bill would restrict that capability in New Hampshire.
