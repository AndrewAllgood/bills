Title: relative to preventing strategic lawsuits against public participation.

This is a pro-freedom / free-speech bill.

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation

	Strategic lawsuits against public participation (also known as SLAPP
	suits or intimidation lawsuits),[1] or strategic litigation against
	public participation,[2] are lawsuits intended to censor, intimidate,
	and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense
	until they abandon their criticism or opposition.[3]

	In a typical SLAPP, the plaintiff does not normally expect to win the
	lawsuit. The plaintiff's goals are accomplished if the defendant
	succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting legal costs, or simple
	exhaustion and abandons the criticism. In some cases, repeated
	frivolous litigation against a defendant may raise the cost of
	directors and officers liability insurance for that party, interfering
	with an organization's ability to operate.[4] A SLAPP may also
	intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often
	preceded by a legal threat. SLAPPs bring about freedom of speech
	concerns due to their chilling effect and are often difficult to
	filter out and penalize because the plaintiffs attempt to obfuscate
	their intent to censor, intimidate, or silence their critics.

New Hampshire is one of the few states without an anti-SLAPP law; and
gets an F on this report card (worse than Massachusetts!)
