Grok summary of committee:

Issues Raised by the CommitteeThe House Commerce and Consumer Affairs
Committee (where HB 359 was referred) expressed several reservations
during and after the hearing, contributing to its ultimate retention
in committee on March 19, 2025 (effectively tabling it without a floor
vote). These concerns, drawn from committee minutes, sponsor
reflections, and legislative tracking, focused on practicality,
unintended consequences, and enforcement challenges rather than
outright opposition to the bill's intent.

Here's a breakdown:Issue

Description

Key Committee Comments/Examples

Vagueness in Definitions
------------------------

Terms like "quantitative, impartial, and risk-based" were seen as too
ambiguous, potentially leading to endless litigation over what
qualifies as "objective."

Chair noted: "How do we measure 'impartiality' without a clear rubric?
This could flood courts with subjective appeals." Witnesses suggested
amendments for federal alignment, but no consensus emerged.

Enforcement and Oversight Burden
--------------------------------

No dedicated state agency for complaints; reliance on existing banking
regulators or lawsuits could strain resources. Who investigates
denials?

Members worried about "opening the floodgates" for frivolous claims,
with one rep asking, "Will this require new bureaucrats to police
every denial letter?"

Unintended Impacts on Legitimate Denials
----------------------------------------

Fear that the bill might force institutions to serve high-risk clients
(e.g., those involved in illegal activities or chronic fraud) under
the guise of "non-risk-based" denials.

Banking reps testified that current practices allow quick cuts to bad
actors; committee probed: "What if denying a scam artist gets labeled
'ideological'?" ESG compliance was a flashpoint.

Federal Preemption and Conflicts
--------------------------------

Overlap with federal laws (e.g., Fair Access rules) and Biden-era
guidance on de-risking; NH's version might invite lawsuits from
national banks.

A Democrat on the committee flagged: "This could clash with OCC
guidelinesâ€”why not wait for federal action?" Sponsors countered it
complements, not contradicts.

Scope Creep to Payment Processors
---------------------------------

Including non-banks like PayPal or Stripe raised questions about
jurisdiction, as they're often interstate.  Concerns: "How do we
enforce against out-of-state entities? This might drive processors
away from NH businesses."

The committee's decision to retain the bill reflects a "wait-and-see"
approach, possibly eyeing reintroduction in the 2026 session (as
hinted by sponsor Corcoran on X). No formal amendments were adopted,
and the session adjourned sine die without further action. For full
transcripts, check the NH General Court's website (gc.nh.gov) or
contact the committee clerk. If you'd like me to dive deeper into
specific testimonies or related bills, let me know!
