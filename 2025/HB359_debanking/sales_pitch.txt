Title: prohibiting denial of banking services based on any factor that
is not quantitative, impartial, and risk-based as measured by an
objective standard.

Right now, banks take unwritten implied direction from regulators and
left wing groups, and deny banking services ("debank") people for
political reasons. 

	  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-banking

	De-banking, more commonly spelled debanking, also known within the
	banking industry as de-risking, is the closure of people's or
	organizations' bank accounts by banks that perceive the account
	holders to pose a financial, legal, regulatory, or reputational
	risk to the bank.

	Examples of this include the enforcement of anti-corruption and
	anti-money laundering laws, the closing of bank accounts of sex
	workers,[1] and people considered to be politically exposed
	persons.[2]

The phrase "reputational risk" is a catch-all.  "We don't want to be
associated with a Nazi (i.e. a Republican candidate for Congress)".

This has been amply covered in the media, and venture capitalist Marc
Andreesen has recently popularized this topic on the Joe Rogan show.

This bill would make it illegal for banks to deny service to someone
based on any factor that is not quantitative, impartial, and
risk-based as measured by an objective standard.

A note: this may at first sound anti-liberty because banks are private
firms, and this is government meddling in private affairs ...but in
fact, given how heavily regulated banks are, (a) there is not a free
market in banking where new entrants can trivially compete for
customers, (b) regulators have extreme "soft" power to whisper
directions to banks.  So, in fact, this is not anti-market, but
anti-government / anti-NGO / anti-leftist.
