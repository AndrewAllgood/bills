LSR Number:2 5-0675
Title: relative to taxing non-profit entities who settle illegal immigrants as for-profit entities.

Various charities, including but not limited to Catholic Charities of
New Hampshire, actively work to harm New Hampshire by settling illegal
immigrants, migrants, "refugees" in New Hampshire

with the explicit goal of reshaping our culture from a
European-centric pro-liberty American culture to one that is more
"inclusive" and "global" (i.e. leftist).  Tons of evidence shows that
as we increase diversity, our crime rates increase and our levels of
social trust decrease ; even the New York Times admits this

Non-profit status is not a right, but a privilege granted by the New
Hampshire state government to encourage pro-social activities that
benefit the citizens of New Hampshire.

Increasing illegal immigration does not help New Hampshire, and should
not be subsidized in the tax code.
