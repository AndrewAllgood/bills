AN ACT relative to the reimbursement of public assistance costs by sponsors of noncitizens and certain temporary residents.

SECTION 1. Statement of Findings and Purpose.

Whereas:
I. New Hampshire taxpayers should not bear the financial burden for individuals residing in the state whose lawful presence is contingent upon federal sponsorship or limited-duration visas.
II. Federal immigration law (8 U.S.C. § 1183a) provides for legally enforceable affidavits of support to ensure financial responsibility for sponsored immigrants.
III. The state has a compelling interest in recovering public assistance funds from legally responsible parties and in ensuring proper cost allocation.

⸻

SECTION 2. Definitions.

In this chapter:
I. “Sponsored noncitizen” means an individual lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent or temporary residence whose sponsor has executed a binding affidavit of support (USCIS Form I-864 or successor).
II. “Temporary resident” means an individual lawfully present in the United States on a temporary, nonimmigrant visa for employment, education, training, or exchange.
III. “Public assistance” includes, but is not limited to, emergency housing, general welfare, medical assistance, legal aid, or any program administered by a state or local agency where funds are disbursed on behalf of the recipient.
IV. “Sponsor” means the individual or entity that executed the affidavit of support or otherwise accepted legal or financial responsibility for the noncitizen’s stay.

⸻

SECTION 3. Notice of Intent to Recover.

I. Upon the provision of public assistance to any sponsored noncitizen, the department of health and human services (or applicable administering agency) shall notify the sponsor of the costs incurred and demand reimbursement within 60 days.

II. If reimbursement is not made within 60 days, the department may initiate a civil action to recover costs from the sponsor under the terms of 8 U.S.C. § 1183a(b)(1)(A), or under New Hampshire law if broader financial liability was contractually accepted.

⸻

SECTION 4. Voluntary Bonding Option for Temporary Residents.

I. A nonimmigrant temporary resident applying for state- or locally-funded public assistance may, in lieu of showing indigency, post a refundable bond to offset the projected cost of services requested.

II. The amount of such bond shall be calculated by the agency based on the nature of services sought, duration of stay, and history of prior claims.

III. No individual shall be compelled to post a bond solely to reside in the state, and no bond shall be required for emergency medical services or lawfully entitled federal programs.

⸻

SECTION 5. Public Assistance Program Integrity and Reporting.

I. All state and local agencies shall be required to screen applicants for public assistance programs to determine:
(a) Whether the applicant is a sponsored noncitizen; and
(b) Whether a legally enforceable affidavit of support exists.

II. Agencies shall maintain records and provide quarterly reports to the Attorney General’s office identifying non-reimbursed costs attributable to sponsored or bonded individuals.

⸻

SECTION 6. Severability Clause.

If any provision of this act or its application is held invalid, the remainder shall not be affected.
