Donal McFarlane:

Perhaps we should start by discussing the ends we are seeking to achieve in those bills?

I’ll throw in a few:

— ensure our own state government is unable either to fund or act as a conduit for funds or otherwise assist <illegal aliens, asylees or refugees of any stripe - henceforth referred to as illegals etc.>

— ensure NGOs operating in the state to provide aid, assistance and other succour and support to <illegals etc.> are (i) not funded by taxpayers; (ii) held to account for the felonious behaviors under either federal law e.g. 8USC1324 or (if only we could) state law which is equivalent to or exceeds or complements those federal statutes.

— remove the need *AND THE ABILITY UNDER LAW* for towns to offer welfare to anyone who steps foot in their town for five minutes and declares domicile, especially and more extensively so in the case where such person is an <illegals etc.>.  We need to make it a punishable crime for the woke welfare officer in Nashua to shower <illegals etc.> with monies and gifts and other nice things.

— something like the above proposal I submitted to attempt to put back systematic costs including healthcare onto sponsors and to demand sponsors or bonding for any purportedly (federally) lawful <illegals etc.> such as approved asylees … and even for legal aliens.

— find a way to demand and ensure EMPLOYERS be arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for knowing (and egregious should-have-known) cases of hiring of <illegals etc.> and <legal aliens without the right work permits>
