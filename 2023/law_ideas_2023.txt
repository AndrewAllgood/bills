Travis,

I read this article earlier today about how agents of the federal
government (US Fish and Wildlife Service) had placed a camera on a
man's property without his knowledge. This has been allowed by the US
Supreme Court, but I am interested in limiting the ability of the
state of New Hampshire to take similar actions.

From what I can tell on the NH Fish and Game's Laws and Rules section
of their website, this is neither explicitly allowed or
disallowed. Would you be willing to put forward a bill to disallow the
state from entering onto private property and installing
recording/monitoring devices without the consent of either the
property owner or -- under reasonable circumstances such as a criminal
investigation -- the court system? If so, what is the best way to make
that happen ahead of the session next year?

If charges are dropped for any felony charges (not due to a plea
bargain) after a certain period (one month, perhaps) then the state
shall reimburse the defendant all legal costs for the dropped felony
charge.
